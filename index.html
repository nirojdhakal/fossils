      <p>Fossil is any one-living things from a past geological age. Example include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stones, imprint of organism objects preserved in amber hair, petrified wood, oil coal and DNA remnant. Simply the preserved remains of ancient plant and animals which lived and where buried beneath within the sedimentary rocks. The word 'fossil' has been derived from the latin word 'fossilium', which literally means any thing dug out of the earth. These are recognisable remains of once-living plants or animal, most of which have been extinct for many thousands of years. They were preserved in sediments, rocks and other materials such as ice, tar, amber etc. prior to historic time. Thus, the remants of plants or animals of the past geologic age preserved in the rock of the earth crust by natural processes are known as 'fossils'.</p>

          <li>Uses of Fossils</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The study of fossils provides evidences in favour of organ evolution and migration of plants and animals through ages.</li>
          <li>They help in establishing the geological age of rock beds and their correct order of succession in any area.</li>
          <li>In the reconstruction of palaeogeography of earth, fossils are paramount significance. For example, presence of fossils trees or strumph indicate the terrestrial environment and in a similar way the fossils of corals and echinoderms, etc. are suggestive of marine environment.</li>
          <li>Fossils also help in ascertaining the palaeoclimate.</li>
          <li>In correlating rock-beds of one area with those of another.</li>
          <li>The relics of ancient life can be used to establish the time sequence of sedimentary rocks. </li>
          <li>Fossils provide evidences of "ontogeny recapitulates phyllogeny". Ontogeny means the development of the individual. Recapitulation means brings and phyllogeny means the race history. This is obvious as the fossils include the ancestors of modern forms.</li>
          <li>The study of fossils constitutes an integral part of any investigation leading to the discovery of new deposits of coal and petroleum.</li>
